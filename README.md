Google Search Results HTML/CSS practice

Additional practice for The Odin Project in HTML and CSS to re-create a Google search results page.

My goals for this project include cementing some of the basic HTML and CSS fundementals as well as dabling in some of the more difficult parts that gave me trouble from the Google Homepage project.
I also hope to get more practice using Git including branches and pushing the project to git hub.
